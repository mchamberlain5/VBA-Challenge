# VBA-Challenge

In this challenge I used VBA script to loop through stock data for one year and output the following information:
  *The ticker symbol.
  *Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  *The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  *The total stock volume of the stock.

I also used conditional formatting within the script to make positive changes green and negative changes red
